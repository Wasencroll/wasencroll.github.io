                as I do not have the strongest computer science or programming background originally. But with every step throughout my
                    career, it has become clearer that I wanted to focus on this field and work on the challenges that come with it.
                    So let's start from the beginning.</p></div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12" style="text-align: justify"><p>I believe it's fair to say that it all started in my last year
                of high school when I was able to participate in a database course at a nearby college. It was then that my passion for
                data was born. Consequently, I did my bachelor's degree in Business Informatics which gave me some basics in databases and
                programming, but nothing too fancy and far from Data Science. Being a dual study program however, I got some great experience
                    in SAP business intelligence projects at my partner company.</br>
                Come as it may, I started my professional career as an SAP business intelligence consultant and enhanced my previous knowledge
                a great deal. I worked with some amazing colleagues from interesting backgrounds who were able to teach me a lot. Don't get me wrong -
                I enjoyed the work very much, while at the same time wondering if I couldn't broaden my skill set to be able to explore a wider
                set of BI and Analytics issues.</p></div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12" style="text-align: justify"><p>It was 2015 and words like <i>Hadoop</i>, <i>Big Data</i> or
                    <i>Data Science</i> kept flying around me. I was intrigued, and as I started to learn more about these topics became
                very interested. I tried teaching myself and learning from experienced colleagues in little side initiatives at work for a while.
                But as with everything you do on the side, I found it tough to focus on it 100% and get the results that I wanted and expected.
                I had always thought about doing a master's and now had discovered a great major for it that would give me a deeper technical
                    background.</br>Today, I am studying a MSc. in Data Science at a small university in Sk√∂vde (Sweden). While deciding on a
                program, it was important to me to enroll in one that had a clear focus on Data Science and was not another business/tech
                combination like my undergraduate program. Now I am doing programming in Scala, R or Python, visualizing data and using
                    algorithms for machine learning or data mining. Who would have ever thought of that!</p></div>

                <div class="col-sm-12" style="text-align: justify"><p>We live in a world where everyone is almost always glancing at a
                phone, tablet or computer screen, so working in front of one of these doesn't really help the issue. Over the years, I came to
                realize that manual labor is actually somewhat relaxing to me and helps clear my mind. I enjoy gardening, harvesting fruits or
                vegetables, but also do a great deal of woodworking. There is always some next project on my mind and I think I actually use my
                    grandfather's workbench more than he does.</br>Aside from this, I truly love traveling. For studies, I have already lived in
                the USA, Australia and Sweden, made amazing friends all over place and enjoy visiting them or just explore some new places. I am
                sure I could go on and on, but you get the general idea. If you want to learn more, shoot me a message or see my Instagram.</p></div>
